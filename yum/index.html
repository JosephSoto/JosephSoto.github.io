	<ol><li> In a wide casserole or heavy-bottomed pan that can hold all the chicken pieces in one layer, heat the oil and put in the onions.</li>
		<li> Saute, stirring over low heat until they soften, then stir in the garlic,
saffron and ginger.</li>
		<li> Put in the chicken pieces, season with salt and pepper, and pour in
about 11/4 cups water.</li>
		<li> Simmer, covered, turning the pieces over a few times and adding a little
water if it becomes too dry.</li>
		<li> Lift out the breasts after 15 minutes and put them to one side. Continue to cook
the remaining pieces for another 25 minutes after which time return the
breasts to the pan.</li>
		<li> Stir into the sauce the lemon juice, the chopped coriander and parsley, the
preserved lemon peel cut into quarters or strips, and the olives.</li>
		<li> Simmer uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes, until the reduced sauce is thick. If there
is too much liquid, lift out the chicken pieces and set them aside while you
reduce the sauce further, then return the chicken to the pan and heat through.</li>
		<li> Present the chicken on dish with the olives and lemon peel on top of the meat.</li>
