<h1>Final Web Design Project</h1>

<p><em>Site</em> Portfolio<br><br>
	<em>Description</em> Although this is a portfolio website, I'd like to use this opportunity to display and curate my design process. Process is integral: the act of making, of creating, and experimenting is just as important as the final product. I find it fascinating to explore the minds of others, their process is a blueprint for that. It presents the designer's tendencies, and their habits. This stage in design is free-forming, and just as beautiful as it's outcome. </p>
